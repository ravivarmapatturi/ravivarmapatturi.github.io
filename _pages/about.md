Hi, I'm **Ravivarma Patturi** üëã

AI Research Engineer at **Boltzmann Labs**, specializing in **Deep Learning, NLP, Generative AI, and Data Science**.

### üî¨ Current Work

At Boltzmann Labs, I develop and deploy state-of-the-art AI solutions:

- **Battery Management Systems**: Implemented sequential neural networks (TCN, RNN, LSTM, GRU) achieving **99% reliability** in SOC predictions. Quantized models using dynamic quantization, reducing model size by **50%** while maintaining accuracy.

- **LLM Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuned **LLaMA 3.2 1B** model on atomistic crystal structure data using LoRA techniques on NVIDIA L40S GPUs for molecular property prediction.

- **Generative AI Applications**: Created a Regulatory QA RAG Chatbot using **GPT-4o** with advanced chunking, parsing, and prompting strategies. Automated SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) generation with **80% syntactic validity**.

- **Molecular AI**: Implemented property prediction pipelines improving accuracy by **15%**. Dockerized and accelerated Molecular Dynamics workflows using GROMACS and OpenMM.

### üöÄ Achievements
